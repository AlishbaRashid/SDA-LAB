Selected Problem 
This system represents a basic e-commerce platform with three types of users:
Customer – Places orders.
Supplier – Supplies products.
Admin – Manages users.
Each of these users requires email validation to ensure they provide a
correctly formatted email (must contain "@" and "."). Initially, 
the validation logic was repeated in all three classes, making the code 
redundant and harder to maintain.

IMPLEMENTING PURE FABRICATION PRINCIPLE:
The Pure Fabrication (GRASP) principle suggests creating a 
separate class to handle responsibilities.
The Validation class is introduced to centralize email validation instead of
repeating it in every user class.
Now, Customer, Supplier, and Admin delegate email validation to
 Validation.validateEmail(email).
This improves code reusability, maintainability, and single responsibility
(each class focuses on its primary function).
By using Pure Fabrication, we achieve cleaner, more scalable code where 
changes to email validation logic can be made in a single place without 
modifying multiple classes.
